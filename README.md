# 💧 Water Quality Monitoring System

> **Real-time detection of water contamination using IoT & cloud intelligence**

---

## 📌 Overview

Ensuring access to **safe drinking water** is a critical challenge for industries, institutions, and communities. Water contamination often goes undetected due to **manual testing, delayed lab reports, or fragmented monitoring systems**.  
This project presents an **IoT-enabled Water Quality Monitoring System** that continuously tracks key water quality parameters and provides instant visibility into water safety.

## 🚨 Problem Statement

| Challenge | Impact |
|---------|--------|
| Manual or periodic testing | Delayed contamination detection |
| No real-time monitoring | Health and safety risks |
| Fragmented data systems | Poor decision-making |
| Compliance difficulties | Regulatory violations |
| Reactive response | Operational losses |

## 🎯 Key Water Quality Parameters Monitored

| Parameter | Description | Standard Reference |
|---------|------------|-------------------|
| **pH** | Acidity/alkalinity of water | WHO / BIS |
| **TDS** | Total dissolved solids | WHO / BIS |
| **Turbidity** | Suspended particles & clarity | WHO / BIS |
| **ORP** | Disinfection effectiveness indicator | AWWA / EPA |

## 🧠 Concept

The system continuously monitors water quality using **industrial-grade sensors**, processes data using **edge computing (ESP32 / Raspberry Pi)**, and visualizes insights on a **cloud dashboard**.  
Any abnormal value triggers **instant alerts**, enabling proactive intervention.
